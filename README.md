The objective of this study is to analyze changes in the inferred cooling, heating and total thermal demand across the Continental United States. 
Temperature proxies of demand are used in this study.
The analysis is presented at the local level and aggregated at electric grid sub-regional level. 


The ERA-5 reanalysis data, for the Texas Interconnect region, is not added in this GitHub repository (due to size constraints) but is available at https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5.
The temperature data are taken from ERA-5 renalysis and are at a 0.5 x 0.5 lat-lon resolution.
