# CONUS-Inferred-Heating-Cooling
Study analyzing climatic drives and low frequency changes in CONUS wide inferred heating and cooling demand.

This is the code repository for the paper "How has a changing climate affected extreme heating and cooling demand across the contiguous United States" by Yash Amonkar (Columbia), James Doss-Gollin (Rice University), David J Farnham (Carnegie Institue for Science/ClimateAi), Vijay Modi (Columbia University), and Upmanu Lall (Columbia). 
This work has been submitted to Nature Energy (https://www.nature.com/nenergy/) for consideration.


The objective of this study is to analyze changes in the extremes of inferred heating and cooling demand across the Continental United States. 
Temperature proxies of Heating Degree Days (HDD) and Cooling Degree Days (CDD) are used in this study.
The temperature data are taken from ERA-5 renalysis and are at a 0.5 x 0.5 lat-lon resolution.
