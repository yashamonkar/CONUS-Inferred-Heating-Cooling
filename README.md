The objective of this study is to analyze changes in the inferred cooling, heating and total thermal demand across the Continental United States. 
Temperature proxies of demand are used in this study.
The analysis is presented at the local level and aggregated at electric grid sub-regional level. 


The ERA-5 reanalysis data, for the Texas Interconnect region, is not added in this GitHub repository (due to size constraints) but is available at https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5.
The temperature data are taken from ERA-5 renalysis and are at a 0.5 x 0.5 lat-lon resolution. 
The entire repository along with the data and generated PDFs is stored here - 
This is a version of the GitHub repository with data and simulations. Added separately due to the size constraints in GitHub.


Abstract - Future net zero scenarios generally require replacing all fossil-fuel heating with electric heat, thereby precipitating higher electricity peak loads during winter. 
Assuming 100 % penetration of efficient electric spaceheating and cooling, this study carries out a spatially explicit trend analysis in temperature-based proxies of electricity demand over the past 70-years. 
As expected, annual mean heating and cooling demand show decreases and increases over most of the contiguous US, respectively. 
Peak thermal load is generally dominated by heating, which shows large inter-annual and decadal variability, thus far not displaying statistically significant decreasing trends. 
In the south, the peak cooling demand has started to dominate the peak demand, but the possibility of an occasional high peak heating demand can not be discounted. Conversely, in the north, the average thermal loads are declining while the peak thermal loads are not.
This points to the need for improved pre-season forecast of peak winter heating loads.
