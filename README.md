# CONUS-Inferred-Heating-Cooling
Study analyzing climatic drives and low frequency changes in CONUS wide inferred heating and cooling demand.

The objective of this study is to analyze changes in the extremes of inferred heating and cooling demand across the Continental United States. 
Temperature proxies of Heating Degree Days (HDD) and Cooling Degree Days (CDD) are used in this study.
The temperature data are taken from ERA-5 renalysis and are at a 0.5 x 0.5 lat-lon resolution.
