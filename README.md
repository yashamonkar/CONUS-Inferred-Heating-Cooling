Study analyzing climatic drives and low frequency changes in CONUS wide inferred heating and cooling demand.
This is the code repository for the paper "Differential effects of climate change on average and peak demand for heating and cooling across the contiguous United States" by Yash Amonkar (Columbia), James Doss-Gollin (Rice University), David J Farnham (Carnegie Institue for Science/ClimateAi), Vijay Modi (Columbia University), and Upmanu Lall (Columbia). 
This work has been submitted to Communications Earth and Environment (https://www.nature.com/commsenv/) for consideration.
The code to replicate this study is presented in this GitHub repository. 


The objective of this study is to analyze changes in the inferred cooling, heating and total thermal demand across the Continental United States. 
Temperature proxies of demand are used in this study.
The analysis is presented at the local level and aggregated at electric grid sub-regional level. 


The ERA-5 reanalysis data is not added in this GitHub repository (due to size constraints) but is available at https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5.
The temperature data are taken from ERA-5 renalysis and are at a 0.5 x 0.5 lat-lon resolution. 
The entire data and code to replicate this study is stored here. 




Abstract - While most electricity systems are designed to handle peak demand during summer months, long-term energy pathways consistent with deep decarbonization generally electrify building heating, thus increasing electricity demand during winter.
A key question is how climate variability and change will affect peak heating and cooling demand in an electrified future.
We conduct a spatially explicit analysis of trends in temperature-based proxies of electricity demand over the past 70 years.
Average annual demand for heating (cooling) decreases (increases) over most of the contiguous US.
However, while climate change drives robust increases in peak cooling demand, trends in peak heating demand are generally smaller and less robust.
Because the distribution of temperature exhibits a long left tail, severe cold snaps dominate the extremes of thermal demand.
As building heating electrifies, system operators must account for these events to ensure reliability.
